# An-approach-to-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-(GANs)-

*****IMPORTANT*****

--------
 
 If you want to run the code locally to your desktop, you have to download the notebook and the **cifar-10-batches-py** folder and put them in the same folder. But before running it you have to decompress (unrar) the 5 batched files that  **cifar-10-batches-py** folder contains
 
-------- 
 
Creation of Adversarial Examples of MNIST and CIFAR - 10 Dataset. Development of Models resistant to Adversarial Attacks

Implementation of 2 Ensembling Techniques ( Separated and Integrated Stacking) for Training the Original Models.

Developping a Random Model Generator that is triggered each time our sytem is under a GAN attack

Please, firstly read carefully the GAN - Problems PDF file.

Regarding the notebook, it contains both the necessary code and comments (Report)  in order to fully understand the approach step - by step.

We have saved the best models both for MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset as well as the ones that are not prone to GAN attacks.
