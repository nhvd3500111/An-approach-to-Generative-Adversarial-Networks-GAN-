# An-approach-to-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-(GANs)-
Creation of Adversarial Examples of MNIST and CIFAR - 10 Dataset. Development of Models resistant to Adversarial Attacks

Please, firstly read carefully the GAN - Problems PDF file.

Regarding the notebook, it contains both the necessary code and comments (Report)  in order to fully understand the approach step - by step.

We have saved the best models both for MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset as well as the ones that are not prone to GAN attacks.
